# Citi-bike Analysis
Two areas of focus were exercised in this analysis to better undestand rider patterns are:
- relationship between time and distance travelled
- ridership patterns by hour of day ride started

## Understand the relationship between time and distance travelled
### Summary
Not surprisingly, ride frequency is greater in or around primary transportation hubs. One factor driving this phenomenon is the magnitude of people in the vicinity versus bike stations located further away from these major hubs.

### Key patterns observed:
- A positive correlation exists between time and distance travelled
- Interestingly, when travel distance is less than 0.65 miles, riders borrow bikes for over 40 minutes while all others average less than 25 minutes
- Bottom 10 Jersey City bike hubs yield higher average trip distances and duration
- Map clearly shows Top 10 hubs are closer to Manhattan and major transportation hubs:


## Assess ridership patters by hour of day bike borrowed
### Summary
A key observation is that trips are greater at times of day where transportation levels trend higher. Compartmenalizing the data for weekdays and weekends, it is apparent trips are peak during rush hour period and afternoon respectively.
### Key patterns observed:
- Across most hours of the day, Bottom 10 bike hubs yield higher average trip times
- Rider count increases steadily over the day until peaking about the 18th hour of the day
- Focusing on the 18th hour of the day, the busiest hour of the day, the start hubs with the longest average trip distances are skewed towards the Bottom 10
- On weekdays, usage is elevated at the seventh and eighth hourse of the morning and between the 17th and 18th hours
- On weekends, usage plateaus between the 12th and 18th hours of the day
